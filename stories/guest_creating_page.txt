Story: A User creating their first Jivepage

  As a guest user
  I want to be able to make a basic page with text and a photo
  So that I can quickly share content with others
  
  Scenario: Guest creating their first Jivepage
  
    Given a guest user
    When they navigate to the homepage
    Then there should be a link to create a new page
    When they click the new page button
    Then they should be redirected to the Page Editor
    And a new page should be created
    And it should have 1 row, 1 column and 1 textblock box    
    And it should have one big column
    And it should have one textblock
    And the textblock should have some default text

  Scenario: Guest reformatting a row

    Given a new page in edit mode
    When the user splits the row into halves
    Then the page should have 2 columns
    And each column should have 1 textblock box
  
  Scenario: Guest adding a textblock to their new page
  
    Given a new page in edit mode
    When the user clicks the column
    Then the content menu appears 
    And it appears at the mouse pointer position
    And the content menu has a text icon
    When the user clicks the text icon
    Then a textblock appears in edit state
